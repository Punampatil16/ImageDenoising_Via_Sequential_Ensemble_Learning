Project Overview

Built an image denoising system using Wavelet Transform, Non-Local Means, and Gaussian Mixture Models to effectively reduce noise and improve overall image quality.

 Approach:

Utilized ensemble learning to combine the strengths of these denoising methods, achieving improved performance through extensive testing and validation.
